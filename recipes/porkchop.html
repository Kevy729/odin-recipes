        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Combine sugar and 2 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt in a small bowl. 
                Lightly pound pork chops with a meat mallet, rolling pin, or the heel of your hand to ½" thick. 
                Pat chops dry; season all over with salt mixture.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high 2 minutes. Add 3 Tbsp. oil, followed by pork chops. 
                Cook chops, pressing down to ensure good contact with pan and turning every minute, until very well browned 
                and charred in spots and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 135°, 5–7 minutes. 
                (Chops will still be a little pink inside; if you prefer yours well-done, cook another minute or two.) 
                Transfer chops to a large plate and let rest 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                While the chops are resting, carefully pour off fat from skillet and wipe out any burnt bits. 
                Heat remaining 1 Tbsp. oil in skillet over medium. Add onion and season with kosher salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, 
                until floppy and lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Working in batches, add radicchio, tossing and letting it wilt 
                slightly before adding more; season with kosher salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until radicchio is wilted and 
                tender with just a little bite in the thickest ribs, about 3 minutes. Squeeze in juice from a lemon half; 
                toss to combine. Transfer radicchio mixture to a platter and drizzle a little honey over.
            </li>
            <li>
                To serve, carve meat away from pork chop bones and slice against the grain; arrange on platter alongside radicchio. 
                Drizzle any accumulated juices over meat and season with sea salt. Serve with Dijon for dragging pork through and 
                remaining lemon half for squeezing over.
